                <h2>Our Purpose </h2>
                <p> At ReciclaTextil, we're driven by a powerful mission: to make a transformative 
                impact on communities through the collection and redistribution of gently used clothing.
                 With a heartfelt dedication to sustainability and social responsibility,
                  we channel our efforts into providing essential clothing items to various institutions,
                   including shelters, orphanages, and community centers. Every donation we receive represents
                    a beacon of hope for individuals and families in need, empowering them with dignity and warmth.
                     With your invaluable support, we can expand our reach, touch more lives, and foster a brighter,
                     more inclusive future for all.</p>
